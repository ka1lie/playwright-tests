Currently created for tests

Main task is do some synthetic test, send the result via API and show it by simple web page with words "Test Success"

What should I do:
  1. Playwright test runs every 1 minute (docker or crontab?)
  2. Playwright test should close after execute to avoid memory leaking
  3. Playwright test should stdout result in file or curl POST?
  4. Web server shoud run forever
  5. Create simple auth to web server
  6. Playwright should use secure auth with encrypted password
